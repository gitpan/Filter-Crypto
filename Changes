Revision history for Perl extension Filter::Crypto.
_________________

v1.10 12 Dec 2004

    - Fix for running encrypted scripts in a mod_perl Apache::Registry setup.

      In such a setup the END subroutine in the CryptoCommon-xs.inc file, which
      free()'s memory allocated in the BOOT: XSUB, gets runs at the end of each
      request (unless the script being filtered was preloaded by the parent
      server process) which caused multiple free()'s of memory that was only
      allocated once (at boot time, in the BOOT: XSUB).

      Instead, we now create a dummy object, blessed into the package concerned,
      which persists throughout the process' lifetime.  When the process exits,
      the object's DESTROY method gets invoked, which is where we now do our
      cleanup.

    - Moved XSLoader::load() calls inside BEGIN subroutines as recommended by
      the XSLoader manpage.  This means that the XSUB's are now installed before
      the rest of the Perl module is compiled, and hence their prototypes are
      now known, and can be checked, during the remaining compilation.

    - Modified t/*-leaktest.pl to output the PID of the perl process running
      them so that it is easier to see which process to watch the memory usage
      of.
