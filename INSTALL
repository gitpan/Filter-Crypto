PREREQUISITES

    Compiler

        You need a C compiler to build these modules.

        Note that you should try to use the same compiler as was used to build
        your Perl itself.

        In particular, Windows users should be aware that these modules will not
        work correctly if they load a different C run-time DLL to that loaded by
        perl itself.  Note that Visual Studio 98 (VC++ 6) and earlier produce
        binaries that require the system's msvcrt.dll, while Visual Studio
        .NET/2003 (VC++ 7), Visual Studio 2005 (VC++ 8) and later (including the
        free Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 and the free Visual C++ 2005 Express
        Edition) produce binaries that require compiler-specific DLLs named
        msvcr70.dll, msvcr71.dll, msvcr80.dll etc.  Therefore, building these
        modules with the anything later than Visual Studio 98 for use with any
        ActivePerl, which are known currently to be built with Visual Studio 98,
        will not work.

        On Windows, the Makefile.PL script will try to detect if a different
        compiler is being used and will give an error if necessary.  Note,
        however, that it is not always possible for it to detect which
        particular compiler version was used to build Perl, especially for Perl
        version 5.8.6 or older, which did not have this information stored in
        the standard library module Config.

    OpenSSL

        OpenSSL (any version), or SSLeay version 0.6.0 or later.
        The latest version of OpenSSL is available from http://www.openssl.org/.

    Perl

        Perl version 5.6.0 or later.
        The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    Perl Modules

        There are no non-standard Perl modules required by the two main modules
        in this distribution (Filter::Crypto::CryptFile and
        Filter::Crypto::Decrypt), but the crypt_file script and the
        PAR::Filter::Crypto module both require

            File::Temp

        which is only a standard Perl module from Perl version 5.6.1 onwards
        (crypt_file only requires it when run with the "-e tempfile" option),
        and the PAR::Filter::Crypto module also requires

            PAR::Filter

        which is part of the PAR distribution.

        A standalone distribution of the File::Temp module, as well as the PAR
        distribution, is available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION

    To install these modules, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL
    file and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    The Makefile.PL script will ask various questions regarding (amongst other
    things) the location of OpenSSL or SSLeay, which cipher algorithm to use,
    what password or key to use and whether to install a script.

    Alternatively, command-line options can be used to provide the answers to
    these questions and hence run the script non-interactively.  Type:

        perl Makefile.PL --help

    for more details.

    On Microsoft Windows platforms, you will need to use "nmake" or "dmake"
    rather than "make" in the commands above, depending on what your Perl was
    built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your Perl
    type the following:

        perl -V:make
