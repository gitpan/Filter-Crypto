________________________________________________________________________________

Revision history for Perl extension Filter::Crypto.
_________________

v1.27 22 Oct 2009

    - Fixed a double-free error in the Decrypt component when using Perl 5.6.2,
      which was detected by some CPAN Testers "FAIL" reports.

      The filter's SV contains a pointer to the filter context.  The SV is made
      magical so that when the SV is destroyed the filter context gets
      automatically freed by the magic virtual table's svt_free function,
      namely, FilterCrypto_FilterSvMgFree().  However, that freed the mg_ptr on
      the magic but didn't set it to NULL, which meant that the caller
      (Perl_mg_free()) potentially tried to free the mg_ptr again.  Prior to
      Perl 5.7.3 it would indeed free the mg_ptr again if mg_len >= 0, which is
      true in this case (our mg_len is always 0), hence the errors with Perl
      5.6.2.  From Perl 5.7.3 onwards (specifically, perl change #14373),
      Perl_mg_free() only frees the mg_ptr again if mg_len > 0, so the double-
      free wouldn't occur with those Perls.  However, it is good practice to set
      pointers to NULL after freeing them, so this is done in
      FilterCrypto_FilterSvMgFree() for all versions of Perl, and all other
      pointers elsewhere are also set to NULL after being freed.

    - Added two new locations in which to check for libcrypto.a on non-Win32
      systems: ${prefix}/lib/amd64 and ${prefix}/lib/sparcv9.  This is where the
      library could be found on 64-bit Solaris Intel and 64-bit Solaris Sparc
      systems respectively, according to answers from the OpenSSL users mailing
      list (openssl-users@openssl.org), and should hopefully resolve a couple of
      CPAN Testers "FAIL" reports from 64-bit Solaris 2.11.

v1.26 18 Oct 2009

    - Declared a minimum version of 1.15 for Pod::Usage.  (In the course of
      investigating [cpan #50533], which I still haven't resolved as of this
      writing, I found that t/03_script.t fails test 99 when using a Perl build
      with an architecture-dependent lib/ folder if Pod[-]Parser is 1.21 or
      older (which contains Pod::Usage 1.14 or older) due to a bug that was
      explicitly fixed in PodParser 1.22 (which contains Pod::Usage 1.15).)

    - Added missing declaration of test scripts' dependency on blib.

    - Silenced a warning produced by old versions of blib by installing an empty
      $SIG{__WARN__} handler when loading it, rather than by not using blib.
      This ensures that the extra work done by blib compared to the simplistic
      "perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib ..." approach is not missed, which might have
      some bearing on some of the CPAN Testers' "FAIL" reports (most of which
      relate to a sufficiently old Perl version to have the old blib concerned).

    - Added a check for "debug" mode Perl builds in Makefile.PL when building
      the "Decrypt" component.  This should ensure that CPAN Testers report
      "N/A" rather than "UNKNOWN" if their Perl builds are "debug" mode.
_________________

v1.25 11 Oct 2009

    - Declare all core module dependencies in the Makefile.PL as well as the
      existing CPAN module dependencies.  (Fixes [cpan #50107].  Thanks to
      Andreas Koenig <ANDK@cpan.org> for persuading me of the merits of doing
      this.)
_________________

v1.24 06 Sep 2009

    - Use Scalar::Util::reftype() instead of UNIVERSAL::isa().  The latter is
      explicitly warned against in the UNIVERSAL documentation, and this also
      avoids a deprecation warning from UNIVERSAL->import() in Perl 5.11.x which
      caused t/03_script.t tests 42 and 47 to fail.
_________________

v1.23 28 Aug 2008

    - Improved crypto library detection so that the library is now correctly
      located in the Win32 OpenSSL Installations produced by Shining Light
      Productions (see http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
      (Fixes [cpan #38780].  Thanks to Erik Weidel <erikweidel@web.de> for
      assistance with this.)
_________________

v1.22 25 Aug 2008

    - Fixed PAR::Filter::Crypto so that it doesn't encrypt the
      Filter/Crypto/Decrypt.pm module, otherwise programs created using
      "pp -F Crypto ..." don't run.  Added new tests to check this.  (Fixes
      [cpan #38638].)

    - Updated Module::Install components from version 0.77 of that distribution.
      (That includes a fix for [cpan #29866], which in turn fixes [cpan #29795]
      in this distribution.)

    - Skipped a couple of tests in t/04_par.t that are known to fail when using
      Module::ScanDeps 0.75 (see changes below for version 1.20).

    - Changed the use of "eval { ... };" to test the return value rather than $@
      since under certain circumstances $@ can end up undefined after a failed
      eval.

    - Changed all Nullxx macros to (XX *)NULL as per perl change #33051 and
      various earlier changes.
_________________

v1.21 06 Jul 2008

    - Added the magic "OS unsupported" phrase to Makefile.PL's die() message so
      that CPAN Testers report "N/A" rather than "FAIL" on OSes where no OpenSSL
      or SSLeay installation has been detected.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.06 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Added the magic "OS unsupported" phrase to Makefile.PL's die() message
        so that CPAN Testers report "N/A" rather than "FAIL" on OSes where the
        appropriate C compiler cannot be found.

    - Updated Module::Install components from version 0.75 of that distribution.
      Changed Makefile.PL appropriately to cope with a non-backwards-compatible
      change in the (undocumented) recommends() method.

    - Added full paths to Cygwin tools used when creating the distribution.
        
    - Updated ppport.h using version 3.14 of the Devel::PPPort distribution.
_________________

v1.20 25 Jul 2007

    - Fixed the decryption filter code to not crash when there is nothing to
      decrypt.  This allows a file containing just
      "use Filter::Crypto::Decrypt;" to run exactly as an empty file would be
      run.

    - Fixed t/03_script.t to skip tests 42 and 47 when built in debug mode since
      they otherwise fail due to the debug output.

    - Documented a known failure in t/04_par.t when using Module::ScanDeps
      version 0.75, and modified PAR::Filter::Crypto to emit a warning if that
      version of Module::ScanDeps is detected since the generated PAR archive
      will probably be missing Filter::Crypto::Decrypt's shared library file in
      that case.
_________________

v1.19 10 Jul 2007

    - Introduced a new FILTER_CRYPTO_FILTER_COUNT macro to determine the number
      of filters currently installed rather than querying PL_rsfp_filters
      directly because that variable no longer exists as of perl change #31200
      which moved it into the PL_parser structure.

    - Changed Perl_my_chsize() to my_chsize() as suggested by the output from
      running "perl ppport.h --compat-version=5.6.0 --copy=.new".

    - Changed some SvPV(), SvPV_nolen() and SvPVX() calls to SvPV_const(),
      SvPV_nolen_const() and SvPVX_const() respectively.

    - Removed definitions of PERL_MAGIC_ext and Poison() for those older Perls
      that don't have them because they are now supplied by ppport.h.

    - Made FilterCrypto_SvSetCUR() safer as per perl changes #26952 and #26953.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.05 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Fixed the compiler version checking on Win32 for Visual C++ 8.x, which
        now uses four numbers separated by dots for its compiler version.
        
    - Updated Module::Install components from version 0.65 of that distribution.

    - Updated ppport.h using version 3.11 of the Devel::PPPort distribution.

    - Added comments to MANIFEST file.
_________________

v1.18 27 Sep 2006

    - Fixed a PATH problem that caused t/04_par.t to fail on some platforms.

      Thanks to Jakub Holy <JHOLY@at.ibm.com> for drawing attention to this
      failure and for suggesting a solution.
_________________

v1.17 14 Feb 2006

    - Fixed two off-by-one errors in the call to ninstr() in the
      Filter::Crypto::Decrypt code as per perl change #26509.

      This code was only working due to a bug in how ninstr() treated empty
      search strings.  However, that bug was fixed in perl change #26510 so the
      call to ninstr() must be fixed for Perls that contain that change.

    - Changed the handling of the salt and the initialization vector in the
      encryption/decryption code so that it does not rely on perl allocating
      exactly the amount of memory requested.

      This was an unsafe assumption to have made, and, in fact, as of perl
      change #24665, is no longer true.  Perl has always been at liberty to
      allocate more memory than was requested if it thinks that would be a good
      idea, and that is exactly what it now does in order to reduce the number
      of realloc()s that might be required.

    - Changed all Newz() and NEWSV() calls to the cleaner Newxz() and newSV()
      respectively, as per perl changes #25101 and #26901, and included ppport.h
      from version 3.08 of the Devel::PPPort distribution to make this possible.

    - Simplified the definition and initialization of the magic virtual table
      used by the decryption filter in the light of perl change #26735.

    - Changed various "use MODULE;" lines to be explicit about what is being
      imported, and in particular to not import things that are not required.

    - Changed the last test in t/03_script.t to not use -T in the PERLDOC
      environment variable since it is not supported before Pod-Perldoc-3.04
      (first shipped in Perl 5.8.1).

    - Fixed a typo in t/04_par.t in which the wrong number of tests were being
      skipped in the case where Archive::Zip is unavailable.

    - Changed t/06_pod.t to use the fully-qualified name of all_pod_files()
      since it was (erroneously) not exported before Test-Pod-1.18.

    - Improved OpenSSL/SSLeay detection on Win32 so that if a Cygwin version is
      found then it is ignored since it will not be of any use.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.04 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Fixed the handling of user-input relative directory paths so that they
        are converted to absolute paths before use in case the Makefile.PL has
        changed to another directory in the meantime;

      * Renamed lots of methods for a better naming convention.

    - Updated Module::Install components from version 0.56 of that distribution
      (together with one minor change, commented in the code, in order to work
      with the new proxy constant subroutines in Perl 5.9.3 and later).
      This includes Module::AutoInstall, which supersedes ExtUtils::AutoInstall.
      Changed Makefile.PL appropriately to take advantage of the new features.

    - Corrected spelling mistakes and improved the grammar in some of the
      documentation.
_________________

v1.16 06 Sep 2005

    - Changed all files back to UNIX end-of-line format.  The previous release
      had accidentally made them all Windows format, which caused t/03_script.t
      test 98 to fail.  Thanks to <COSIMO@cpan.org> for the spot.

    - Modified PREOP key in the dist option in Makefile.PL to ensure files are
      all UNIX format in the future to stop this from happening again.
_________________

v1.15 02 Sep 2005

    - Improved crypto library detection so that the library is now correctly
      located on 64-bit systems that have both $PREFIX/lib and $PREFIX/lib64.
      (Fixes [cpan #14397].  Thanks to <COSIMO@cpan.org> for assistance with
      this.)

      Also improved the binary executable detection along the same lines.

    - Changed test scripts from using Test to Test::More for better diagnostic
      output in case of failures.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.03 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Relaxed the compiler version checking so that only the major version
        numbers have to match (and also the minor version numbers for VC++ 7 and
        later, which use CRT DLLs named msvcr70.dll, msvcr71.dll, etc)
        
        (Thanks to Sisyphus <sisyphus1@optusnet.com.au> for drawing attention to
        this problem via the PAR mailing list (par@perl.org));

      * Fixed the parsing of bcc32's output as per perl change #24855.

    - Dropped the use of I<> for Perl variables in POD, in line with changes
      made (some time ago) to the perlpod manpage (perl change #12542).

    - Corrected spelling mistake: INITIALISATION should be INITIALIZATION.

    - Updated Module::Install and ExtUtils::AutoInstall components from versions
      0.37 and 0.62 of those distributions respectively.
_________________

v1.14 01 Jun 2005

    - Added an --unsafe-mode option to Makefile.PL to specify that the "Decrypt"
      component should be built in an "unsafe" mode in which the Perl compiler
      backend modules are allowed to be loaded.

    - Added a --debug-mode option to Makefile.PL to specify that the modules
      should be built in "debug" mode.

    - Perl 5.8.7 contains a fix for PerlLIO_chsize() for those systems that do
      not have chsize() so there is no need for the workaround in
      CryptFile/CryptFile.xs from Perl 5.8.7 onwards.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.02 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * ExtUtils::AutoInstall command-line options are now better supported,
        fixing problems with custom option handling that did not recognize them;

      * Errors now croak() rather than die() so that the error messages look a
        little more friendly;

      * If the "auto install" checks loaded Test::Builder then that module's
        cleanup diagnostic code is now skipped, which suppresses the somewhat
        confusing (given the context) message

          # Looks like your test died before it could output anything.

        in the event of any subsequent error that causes Makefile.PL to croak().
_________________

v1.13 14 Mar 2005

    - The previous fix to t/03_script.t did not do the job for the original bug
      reporter, so try a different approach: rather than trying to cope with the
      various format outputs produced by "perldoc" on different OSes, use the
      PERLDOC environment variable to ask for plain text output (-t).  We can
      also avoid involving a pager (-T).
_________________

v1.12 09 Mar 2005

    - Fixed t/03_script.t test 99 to account for different format output
      produced by "perldoc" on some OSes.

      Thanks to <cpan@calaquendi.net> for drawing attention to this problem via
      CPAN Testers (http://testers.cpan.org/).
_________________

v1.11 03 Mar 2005

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it now sets STDIN to "binary mode" if it is
      reading input from STDIN.

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it now accepts a single input file specifier
      consisting of just '-' to mean STDIN so that one can write commands like
      "someprogram | crypt_file -".

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it no longer tries to flock() STDIN or STDOUT
      when they are some other program's STDOUT or STDIN respectively because
      this does not work on Win32 (at least).  All of the following commands
      should now work:

          crypt_file                    STDIN from keyboard
          crypt_file <file              STDIN from file
          someprogram | crypt_file -    STDIN from someprogram

          crypt_file                    STDOUT to console
          crypt_file >file              STDOUT to file
          crypt_file | someprogram -    STDOUT to someprogram

    - Added new tests for these changes.

    - Changed the use of qq["$^X"] in some test scripts to only include the
      double-quotes if $^X actually contains a space since shell commands like

          qq["$^X" -e print(1) | "$^X" -ne print];

      (used in the new tests) do not work under Perl 5.6.0 on Win32 (at least)
      with the double-quotes included.  (These tests will therefore still fail
      in cases where $^X does contain a space, but that's not an ideal
      configuration anyway.)

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.01 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Added code to try to check that on Win32 the same compiler is being used
        to build these modules as was used to build Perl itself to avoid
        problems with binaries built by different compiler versions loading
        different C run-time DLLs.

    - Added a recommendation for Test::Pod to Makefile.PL to test the POD when
      building these modules.

    - Corrected spelling mistakes: finalise, initialise, localise, recognise and
      utilise are more properly spelled finalize, initialize, localize,
      recognize and utilize respectively.
_________________

v1.10 12 Dec 2004

    - Fix for running encrypted scripts in a mod_perl Apache::Registry set-up.

      In such a set-up the END subroutine in the CryptoCommon-xs.inc file, which
      free()s memory allocated in the BOOT: XSUB, gets runs at the end of each
      request (unless the script being filtered was preloaded by the parent
      server process), which caused multiple free()s of memory that was only
      allocated once (at boot time, in the BOOT: XSUB).

      Instead, we now create a dummy object, blessed into the package concerned,
      that persists throughout the process' lifetime.  When the process exits,
      the object's DESTROY method gets invoked, which is where we now do our
      cleanup.

    - Moved XSLoader::load() calls inside BEGIN subroutines as recommended by
      the XSLoader manpage.  This means that the XSUBs are now installed before
      the rest of the Perl module is compiled, and hence their prototypes are
      now known, and can be checked, during the remaining compilation.

    - Modified t/*-leaktest.pl to output the PID of the perl process running
      them so that it is easier to see which process to watch the memory usage
      of.
