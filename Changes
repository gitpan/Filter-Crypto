                          Filter::Crypto, Version 1.14
________________________________________________________________________________

Revision history for Perl extension Filter::Crypto.
_________________

v1.14 01 Jun 2005

    - Added an --unsafe-mode option to Makefile.PL to specify that the "Decrypt"
      component should be built in an "unsafe" mode in which the Perl compiler
      backend modules are allowed to be loaded.

    - Added a --debug-mode option to Makefile.PL to specify that the modules
      should be built in "debug" mode.

    - Perl 5.8.7 contains a fix for PerlLIO_chsize() for those systems that
      don't have chsize() so there is no need for the workaround in
      CryptFile/CryptFile.xs from Perl 5.8.7 onwards.

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.02 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * ExtUtils::AutoInstall command-line options are now better supported,
        fixing problems with custom option handling that didn't recognize them;

      * Errors now croak() rather than die() so that the error messages look a
        little more friendly;

      * If the "auto install" checks loaded Test::Builder then that module's
        cleanup diagnostic code is now skipped, which suppresses the somewhat
        confusing (given the context) message

          # Looks like your test died before it could output anything.

        in the event of any subsequent error that causes Makefile.PL to croak().

v1.13 14 Mar 2005

    - The previous fix to t/03_script.t didn't do the job for the original bug
      reporter, so try a different approach: rather than trying to cope with the
      various format outputs produced by "perldoc" on different OS's, use the
      PERLDOC environment variable to ask for plain text output (-t).  We can
      also avoid involving a pager (-T).

v1.12 09 Mar 2005

    - Fixed t/03_script.t test 99 to account for different format output
      produced by "perldoc" on some OS's.

      Thanks to <cpan@calaquendi.net> for drawing attention to this problem via
      CPAN Testers (http://testers.cpan.org/).

v1.11 03 Mar 2005

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it now sets STDIN to "binary mode" if it is
      reading input from STDIN.

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it now accepts a single input file specifier
      consisting of just '-' to mean STDIN so that one can write commands like
      "someprogram | crypt_file -".

    - Fixed crypt_file so that it no longer tries to flock() STDIN or STDOUT
      when they are some other program's STDOUT or STDIN respectively because
      this doesn't work on Win32 (at least).  All of the following commands
      should now work:

          crypt_file                    STDIN from keyboard
          crypt_file <file              STDIN from file
          someprogram | crypt_file -    STDIN from someprogram

          crypt_file                    STDOUT to console
          crypt_file >file              STDOUT to file
          crypt_file | someprogram -    STDOUT to someprogram

    - Added new tests for these changes.

    - Changed the use of qq["$^X"] in some test scripts to only include the
      double-quotes if $^X actually contains a space since shell commands like

          qq["$^X" -e print(1) | "$^X" -ne print];

      (used in the new tests) don't work under Perl 5.6.0 on Win32 (at least)
      with the double-quotes included.  (These tests will therefore still fail
      in cases where $^X does contain a space, but that's not an ideal
      configuration anyway.)

    - Updated Module::Install::PRIVATE to version 1.01 for Makefile.PL
      improvements:

      * Added code to try to check that on Win32 the same compiler is being used
        to build these modules as was used to build Perl itself to avoid
        problems with binaries built by different compiler versions loading
        different C runtime DLL's.

    - Added a recommendation for Test::Pod to Makefile.PL to test the POD when
      building these modules.

    - Corrected spelling mistakes: finalise, initialise, localise, recognise and
      utilise are more properly spelled finalize, initialize, localize,
      recognize and utilize respectively.

v1.10 12 Dec 2004

    - Fix for running encrypted scripts in a mod_perl Apache::Registry setup.

      In such a setup the END subroutine in the CryptoCommon-xs.inc file, which
      free()'s memory allocated in the BOOT: XSUB, gets runs at the end of each
      request (unless the script being filtered was preloaded by the parent
      server process) which caused multiple free()'s of memory that was only
      allocated once (at boot time, in the BOOT: XSUB).

      Instead, we now create a dummy object, blessed into the package concerned,
      which persists throughout the process' lifetime.  When the process exits,
      the object's DESTROY method gets invoked, which is where we now do our
      cleanup.

    - Moved XSLoader::load() calls inside BEGIN subroutines as recommended by
      the XSLoader manpage.  This means that the XSUB's are now installed before
      the rest of the Perl module is compiled, and hence their prototypes are
      now known, and can be checked, during the remaining compilation.

    - Modified t/*-leaktest.pl to output the PID of the perl process running
      them so that it is easier to see which process to watch the memory usage
      of.
