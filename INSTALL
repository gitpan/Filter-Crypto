INSTALLATION

    To install these modules, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL
    file and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    The Makefile.PL script will ask various questions regarding (amongst other
    things) the location of OpenSSL or SSLeay, which cipher algorithm to use,
    what password or key to use and whether or not to install a script.

    Alternatively, command-line options can be used to provide the answers to
    these questions and hence run the script non-interactively.  Type

        perl Makefile.PL --help

    for more details.

    On Microsoft Windows platforms, you will need to use "nmake" or "dmake"
    rather than "make" in the commands above, depending on what your Perl was
    built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your Perl
    type the following:

        perl -V:make

    Note that you should try to use the same compiler to build this module as
    was used to build your Perl itself.

    In particular, Windows users should note that linking against the msvcrt.lib
    import library that comes with recent versions of the Microsoft Visual C++
    compiler (version 7 and above) now produces binaries that depend on
    compiler-specific DLL's named msvcr70.dll, msvcr71.dll, etc, rather than the
    OS's msvcrt.dll.  These modules may not work correctly if you build them
    with a different compiler than was used to build your Perl such that two
    different C runtime DLL's get loaded.

PREREQUISITES

    OpenSSL (any version), or SSLeay version 0.6.0 or later.
    The latest version of OpenSSL is available from http://www.openssl.org/.

    Perl version 5.6.0 or later.
    The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    There are no non-standard Perl modules required by the two main modules in
    this distribution (Filter::Crypto::CryptFile and Filter::Crypto::Decrypt),
    but the crypt_file script and the PAR::Filter::Crypto module both require

        File::Temp

    which is only a standard Perl module from Perl version 5.6.1 onwards
    (crypt_file only requires it when run with the "-e tempfile" option), and
    the PAR::Filter::Crypto module also requires

        PAR::Filter

    which is part of the PAR distribution.

    A standalone distribution of the File::Temp module, as well as the PAR
    distribution, are both available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).
